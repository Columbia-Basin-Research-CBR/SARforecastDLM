<p>The first year in the marine environment plays a large role in the survival of wild, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon. Large-scale ocean indices, such as CUI, otherwise known as the Bakun Index, have been shown to be highly correlated with salmon survival in coastal waters due to bottom-up food web dynamics. Scheuerell and Williams (2005) argued that by including upwelling indices as a measure of ocean conditions during ocean entry for juvenile salmon compared with historically reported salmon return rates, a DLM forecast can better predict how changing ocean conditions can affect future salmon marine survival.</p>

<p>In an ever changing system, managers and conservation efforts are continuously striving for more adaptive management practices to mitigate the decline of ESU-listed salmon. One highly sought after tool in the adaptive management toolbox, is the ability to accurately forecast and predict the response of salmon to a changing environment. While, retrospective analysis provide insight into what drives changes in salmon surival, Scheurell and Williams (2005) aimed to provide a forward looking prediction of salmon ocean survival through time-varying successive forecasts using DLMs. DLMs are a form of linear regression, but where a linear regression's parameters are static in time, a DLM allows parameters to vary through time and uses past information to inform 1 yr ahead forecasts. This type of forecast provides more explicit predictions using time-series analysis.</p>

<p>In an effort to expand the toolbox available to managers, this application aims too provide access to the work completed by Scheurell and Williams (2005) in an interactive format, while also using the methodological approaches described with additional upwelling indices, such as the Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI) as a way to further highlight advances in our understanding of the connection between salmon and upwelling indices.</p>
