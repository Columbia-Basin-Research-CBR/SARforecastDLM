  <p>The first year in the marine environment plays a pivotal role in the survival of wild, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon. Large-scale ocean indices, such as CUI or the Bakun Index, have been shown to be highly correlated with salmon survival in coastal waters due to bottom-up food web dynamics. Scheuerell and Williams (2005) argued that by including upwelling indices as a measure of ocean conditions during ocean entry for juvenile salmon compared with historically reported salmon return rates, a DLM forecast can better predict how changing ocean conditions can affect future salmon marine survival.</p>
  <p>In an ever-changing system, managers and conservation efforts continuously strive for more adaptive management practices to mitigate the decline of ESU-listed salmon. One highly sought-after tool in the adaptive management toolbox is the ability to accurately forecast and predict the response of salmon to a changing environment. While retrospective analysis provides insight into what drives changes in salmon survival, Scheurell and Williams (2005) aimed to provide a forward-looking prediction of salmon ocean survival through time-varying successive forecasts using a DLM. DLMs are a form of linear regression, but where a linear regression's parameters are static in time, a DLM allows parameters to vary through time and uses past information to inform 1 yr ahead forecasts. This type of forecast provides more explicit predictions using time-series analysis.</p>
  <p>This application is an additional item in the toolbox for managers and conservation efforts. It provides interactive access to the research by Scheuerell and Williams (2005), allowing users to explore the methodological approaches and their implications for salmon survival. The inclusion of additional indicators of the ocean ecosystem, such as CUTI and ICPB, further enhances our understanding of the connection between early salmon lifestages and changing ocean conditions, potentially improving adaptive management practices.</p>
