<p><b>SARforecastDLM</b> can be used to explore wild, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon, <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>, one-year ahead forecasted survival based on changes in indices of ocean upwelling.</p>

<br>
<p>This application uses Dynamic Linear Modelling (DLM) to forecast salmon survival using time varying parameters such as, <b>smolt- to- adult survival ratio (SAR)</b> and coastal upwelling indices, <b>Coastal Upwelling Indice (CUI) and Coastal Upwelling Transport Indice (CUTI).</b></p>
<br>
<p>To explore the application, select the <i>Forecast survival</i> page in the side panel, or continue to the <i>Overview</i> section to learn more about how this application can assist is addressing knowledge-action gaps.</p>


<p><i>Please note that this Shiny App is dependent on data availability and serves as an exploratory tool.</i></p>
