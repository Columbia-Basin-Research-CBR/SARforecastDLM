<p><b>SARforecastDLM</b> can be used to explore wild, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon, <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>, one-year ahead forecasted survival based on changes in indices of ocean upwelling.</p>


<p>This application uses Dynamic Linear Modelling (DLM) to forecast salmon survival using time varying parameters such as, <b>smolt- to- adult survival ratio (SAR)</b> and <b>coastal upwelling indices, Coastal Upwelling Indice (CUI) and Coastal Upwelling Transport Indice (CUTI).</b> To explore the application, select the <i>Forecast survival</i> page in the side panel.</p>



<p>In an ever changing system, managers and conservation efforts are continuously striving for more adaptive management practices to mitigate the decline of ESU-listed wild, spring/summer Snake River chinook salmon. One useful item in the adaptive management toolbox, is the ability to accurately forecast and predict the response of salmon to a changing environment. While, retrospective analysis provide insight into what drives changes in salmon surival, Scheurell and Williams (2005) aimed to instead provide a more foreward looking forecast of salmon ocean survival through time-varying successive forecasts using dynamic linear modelling. DLMs are a form of linear regression, but where parameters are static in time in a linear regressions, a DLM allows parameters to vary through time and uses past information to inform 1 yr ahead forecasts.</p>
