<p><b>SARforecastDLM</b> can be used to explore wild, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon, <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>, one-year ahead forecasted survival based on changes in indicators of the ocean ecosystem within the Northern California Current (NCC).</p>

<br>
<p>This application utilizes dynamic linear modeling (DLM) to forecast salmon survival, incorporating time-varying parameters such as smolt-to-adult survival ratio (SAR), alongside long-term ocean ecosystem indicators including indices of upwelling and prey availability,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI), otherwise known as the Bakun Upwelling Index, <a href="https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/references/Bakun_UI_1973.pdf">(Bakun 1973,</a><a href="https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/references/Bakun_UI_1975.pdf">1975)</a></li>
  <li>Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014187"> (Jacox et al 2018)</a></li>
  <li>Index of Coastal Prey Biomass (ICPB), <a href="https://doi.org/10.3354/meps10320">(Daly et al 2013)</a></li>
</ul>
Users can then select between three different estimates of SAR to explore changes in forecasted survival, such as:
<ul>
  <li>1964 to 2005 SAR reported in Scheurell and Williams (2005),</li>
  <li>2003 to present SAR reported by Columbia Basin Research, DART, and </li>
  <li>1994 to 2019 SAR estimates via Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) modelling</li>
</ul>
