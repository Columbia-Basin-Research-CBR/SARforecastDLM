<b>Study system and fish</b>
<p>The study area of this application includes the migratory pathway of wild, spring/summmer Snake River Chinook salmon through the Lower Snake and Columbia River basin, including the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRSP), Pacific Northwest, USA. Currently this application does not delineate between tranportation types through the hydrosystem and is specific to wild, or natural-origin, spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon.</p>

<b>Smolt-to-adult (SAR)</b>
<p>This application uses three different metrics of Smolt-to-adult survival rates (SAR) to forecast salmon ocean survival. For all estimates, SAR is a measure of the proportion of juvenile salmon that survive to return as adults. Unless explicitly stated, SAR is based on detection histories of outmigrating juveniles passing Lower Granite Dam (LGR) and adult return migration detection at Lower Granite Dam, adult site (LGA). Specific methodolgies per SAR are summarized below:</p>

<i>Scheuerell and Williams (2005)</i>
<p>Includes 37 years of smolt-to-adult return rates from 1964 to 2005 provided via the MARSS R package that reflect the data reported in Scheuerell and Williams (2005) (Holmes et al., 2014). In that time period, changes to operations within the FCRPS, including the addition of 3 upper dams, required adjustments to the method of reporting juvenile and adult counts to estimate abundances (counts from: Ice Harbor Dam (1964-1969), Lower Monumental Dam (1969), Little Goose Dam (1970-1974), Lower Granite Dam (1975 - 2005)). To see the specific methodolgies used to estimate smolt-return-rates reported, see Scheuerell and Williams (2005) and Williams et al., (2005) for explanation.</p>

<i> DART, Columbia Basin Research</i>
<p>SAR rates are made publically available via cbr.washington.edu/dart/pit_sar_esu and include data courtesy of Pacific States Marine Fisheres Commission. Detections include wild, spring/summer Snake River passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged fish detected at Lower Granite Dam (LGR) as juvenile with a return detection at LGR from 2002 to 2021. The detection histories include all juveniles detections at Lower Granite including spillway (GRS) and bypass/transport facilities (GRJ). Returning fish detected within the same year as outmigration detections were excluded (e.g., 0 and 1-Year adult detections).  </p>
<i>CJS estimated SAR</i>
<p>Detection data included within the CJS model is the same as the detection data used in the SAR rates reported via DART, Columbia Basin Research. We then used a Hierarchical Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model to estimate apparent survival based on a more simplified version of the methods described in Gosselin et al. (2019) (Cormack 1964, Jolly 1965, Seber 1965). Where Gosselin etl al. (2019). included 12 covariates, no covariates were included within our CJS model. Detection history per fish and reach was assigned 1 if fish was detected per location (LGR, BON, TWX, BOA, LGA, TRIBS), or a 0 for no detection. Using this binary detection history, we applied a logit-linear regression with year-varying intercepts using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (HMC; Monnahan et al., 2017) fit with RStan via R (Stan Development Team 2023, R Core Team 2023). To see more specifics of how the CJS model was fit, see Gosselin et al. (2019).

<b>Ocean Indices</b>
<p></p>

<p>Two indices of coastal upwelling are included within this application, the Pacific Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI), also known as the Bakun index, and the Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI), both made publically available via ERDAPP R package and data server on behalf of NOAA fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Environmental Research Division. This application includes the values reported in cubic meters of seawater per second per 100 m of coastline for the location 45&deg;N latitude and 125&deg;W longitude for both indices and were last accessed, April 30th, 2024. Using the data and methods provided via the MARSS R package (Holmes et al., 2014) in tadem with Applied Time Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences (Holmes et al., 2021), we included the month of April for each of the upwelling indices due to the strong upwelling events that occur within the month, prior to juvenile salmon ocean entry in May and June.</p>

In addition to the upwelling indices, an index of coastal prey biomass (ICPB) is included within this application. The ICPB is an indice of larval prey as measure of food availability for Chinook salmon, whose diet primarly consists of winter-spawning late-larval and early juvenile fish. Late larval and early juvenile stage fish tend to be underrepresented in larger trawl nets making them an unreliable metric, whereas at the larval stage they can be better estimated via ichthyoplankton sampling. Samples are taken in winter (Jan, Feb, Mar) along the Newport Oregon Hydrographic Line (44.65&deg;N) and reported in grams per square meter (Daly et al., 2013). Data used within this application is courtesy of E. Daly, NWFSC, NOAA, provided October, 2019. Due to limited years of early data (pre-1998), only DART and CJS estimated SAR rates are used with the ICPB indice.  </p>

<b>Model methods</b>
<body>
<p> A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) was used to forecast salmon survival using marine indices following the methods outlined in Applied time series analysis for fisheries and environmental data, featuring Scheuerell and Williams (2005) previous work (Holmes et al., 2021). DLMs are state-space model that include time-varying parameters, which allows for short term forecasts to be generated for each time step. Such that the model relies on prior data to predict the year of interest in a one-year ahead forecast of salmon survival and relies on two equations, an observational equation (Eq. 1) and an evolution equation (Eq. 2). For the observational equation,</p>

  \[
  \begin{equation}
  survival_t = \alpha_t + \beta_t x_t + v_t \text{ with } v_{t}\sim\,\text{N}(0,r), \tag{Eq. 1}\\
  \end{equation}
  \]

  <p>At each successive time step, \(t\) the observed response, \(survival_t\), is fitted to a \(1 \times m\) vector for each predictor variable where \(m\) represents \(m \times 1\) regression parameters included plus an observational error term, \(v_t\). The predictor variable, \(\beta_t\), representing the month of April for CUI or CUTI. This model includes both a random slope and intercept, therefore \(m\) includes two time-varying regression parameters,</p>

  \[
  \begin{align}
  \alpha_t &= \alpha_{t-1} + w_{\alpha,t} \text{ with } w_{\alpha,t} \sim \,\text{N}(0,q_{\alpha})\tag{Eq. 1.1}\\
  \beta_t &= \beta_{t-1} + w_{\beta,t} \text{ with } w_{\beta,t} \sim \,\text{N}(0,q_{\beta}) \tag{Eq. 1.2}.
  \end{align}
  \]

  <p>Where the \(m \times 1\) vector of regression parameters is defined as \(\theta_t\) and evolves through time according to the first-order Markov process seen in the evolution equation:</p>

  \[
  \begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{\theta}_t = \mathbf{G}_t\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1} + \mathbf{w}_t \text{ with } \mathbf{w}_t \sim \,\text{MVN}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}) \tag{Eq. 2}\\
  \end{equation}
  \]

  <p>where \(\mathbf{G}_t\) is the parameters evolution matrix, in this case,  an \(m \times m\) identity matrix that informs how the parameters, \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}\), change through time. The system variance matrix, \(\mathbf{w}_t\), represents the evolution process error at time \(t\) (Pole et al., 1994). \(W_t\) is assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrix \(\mathbf{Q}\), where \(\mathbf{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}q_\alpha& 0 \\ 0&q_\beta\end{bmatrix}\). </p>
