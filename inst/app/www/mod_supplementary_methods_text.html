<b>Study system and fish</b>
<p>The study area of this application includes the migratory pathway of wild, spring/summmer Snake River Chinook salmon through the Lower Snake and Columbia River basin, including the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRSP), Pacific Northwest, USA. Currently this application does not delineate between tranportation types of salmon through the hydrosystem.</p>

<b>Smolt-to-adult (SAR)</b>
<p>This application uses three different metrics of smolt-to-adult survival rates (SAR) to forecast salmon ocean survival. For all estimates, SAR is a measure of the proportion of juvenile salmon that survive to return as adults. Unless explicitly stated, SARs featured in this application are based on detection histories of outmigrating juveniles passing Lower Granite Dam (LGR) and returning adult migration detection at Lower Granite Dam, adult site (LGA). Specific methodolgies per SAR are further summarized below:</p>

<i>Scheuerell and Williams (2005)</i>
<p>Includes 37 years of smolt-to-adult return rates from 1964 to 2005 provided via the MARSS R package that reflect the data reported in Scheuerell and Williams (2005) (Holmes et al., 2014). During that time period, changes to operations within the FCRPS, including the addition of 3 upper dams, required adjustments to the method of reporting juvenile and adult counts to estimate abundances. These counts were taken from Ice Harbor Dam (1964-1969), Lower Monumental Dam (1969), Little Goose Dam (1970-1974), and Lower Granite Dam (1975-2005). For more detailed information used to estimate smolt-return-rates reported, see Scheuerell and Williams (2005) and Williams et al. (2005) for explanation.</p>

<i>Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time)</i>
<p>SAR rates from 2002 to the most recent year of adult returns were accessed via <a href= "https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/pit_sar_esu">cbr.washington.edu</a>, with data courtesy of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. Detection histories include passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged fish detected at Lower Granite Dam (LGR) as juveniles, with return detections at LGA from 2002 to the most complete year of adult returns. For example, CY2024 includes SAR data from 2002 to 2020 to ensure the majority of fish have returned. The detection histories include all juveniles detections at Lower Granite including spillway (GRS) and bypass/transport facilities (GRJ). Returning fish detected within the same year as outmigration detections were excluded (e.g., 0 and 1-Year adult detections).  </p>
<i>Cormack-Jolly-Seber</i>
<p>The detection data included in the CJS model is the same as the detection data used for the SAR rates reported via DART, Columbia Basin Research. We then used a Hierarchical Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model to estimate apparent survival based on a more simplified version of the methods described in Gosselin et al. (2021) (Cormack 1964, Jolly 1965, Seber 1965). Unlike Gosselin et al. (2021). no covariates were included within our CJS model. Detection history per fish and reach was assigned 1 if fish was detected per location (LGR, BON, TWX, BOA, LGA, TRIBS), or a 0 for no detection. Using this binary detection history, we applied a logit-linear regression with year-varying intercepts using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (HMC; Monnahan et al., 2017) fit with RStan via R (Stan Development Team 2023, R Core Team 2023). To see more specifics of how the CJS model was fit, see Gosselin et al. (2021).

<b>Ocean Indices</b>
<p></p>

<i>Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI) and Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI)</i>
<p>Two indices of coastal upwelling are included within this application, the Pacific Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI) or Bakun index (Bakun 1973,1975), and the Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI) (Jacox et al., 2018), both made publically available via ERDAPP R package and data server on behalf of NOAA fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Environmental Research Division. This application includes the values reported in cubic meters of seawater per second per 100 m of coastline for the location 45&deg;N latitude and 125&deg;W longitude for both indices and were last accessed, June 6th, 2024. Following the methods outlined in MARSS R package (Holmes et al., 2014) further detailed in 'Applied Time Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences' (Holmes et al., 2021), we included the month of April in each of the upwelling indices due to the strong upwelling events that occur during this month, which precedes the ocean entry of juvenile salmon in May and June.</p>

<i>Index of Coastal Prey Biomass (ICPB)</i>
<p>In addition, an Index of Coastal Prey Biomass (ICPB) is included within this application. The ICPB is an indice of larval prey as a measure of food availability for Chinook salmon, whose diet primarly consists of winter-spawning late-larval and early juvenile fish (Daly et al., 2013). However, late larval and early juvenile-stage fish tend to be underrepresented in larger trawl nets making them an unreliable metric, whereas the larval stage they can be better estimated via ichthyoplankton sampling. Samples are taken in winter (Jan, Feb, Mar) along the Newport Oregon Hydrographic Line (44.65&deg;N) and reported in grams per square meter. Data used within this application is courtesy of E. Daly, NWFSC, NOAA, provided October, 2019. Due to limited years of early data (pre-1998), only DART and CJS estimated SAR rates are used with the ICPB indice. </p>

<i>Northern Copepod Biomass Index (NCBI)</i>
<p>In addition, the Northern Copepod Biomass Index (NCBI) is included within this application. Copepod biodiversity is a measure of species richess found within plankton samples along the Oregon coast collected at the Newport Oregon Hydrographic Line (44.65&deg;N) and reported in grams per square meter. Copepod biomass is comprised of Southern and Northern species assembledges. Northern species dominate the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, and in the summer months, predominates Oregon and Washington coastal waters. Changes in the copepod biomass anomaly can reflect shifts in biodiversity available to juvenile salmon entering coastal waters in the spring and summer months, with higher species richness indicating lower biodiversity (Hooff and Peterson, 2006). Similar to other indices within this application, we included the month of April as our biomass indicator. Due to limited years of early data (pre-1998), only DART and CJS estimated SAR rates are used with the NCBI indice. </p>

<b>Model methods</b>
<body>
<p> A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) was used to forecast salmon survival using marine indices following similar methods outlined in 'Applied Time Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences', featuring Scheuerell and Williams (2005) previous work (Holmes et al., 2021). This Shiny application, designed to explore marine indices alongside recent SAR estimation methods, incorporates key assumptions differing from Scheuerell and Williams (2005) to enable successful forecasting with SAR methods having fewer years (DART and CJS). These assumptions include fixing the observation process error for DART and CJS SARs and allowing the variance-covariance matrix of the evolution equation to vary between and covary among states, as discussed below.</p>

<p>DLMs are state-space model that include time-varying parameters, which allows for short term forecasts to be generated for each time step. Such that the model relies on prior data to predict the year of interest in a one-year ahead forecast of salmon survival and relies on two equations, an observational equation (Eq. 1) and an evolution equation (Eq. 2). For the observational equation,</p>

  \[
  \begin{equation}
  survival_t = \alpha_t + \beta_t x_t + v_t \text{ with } v_{t}\sim\,\text{N}(0,r), \tag{Eq. 1}\\
  \end{equation}
  \]

  <p>At each successive time step, \(t\) the observed response, \(survival_t\), is fitted to a \(1 \times m\) vector for each predictor variable where \(m\) represents \(m \times 1\) regression parameters included plus an observational error term, \(v_t\). The predictor variable, \(\beta_t\), representing the month of April for CUI or CUTI, or the total mean biomass from January to March for ICPB. This model includes both a random slope and intercept, therefore \(m\) includes two time-varying regression parameters,</p>

  \[
  \begin{align}
  \alpha_t &= \alpha_{t-1} + w_{\alpha,t} \text{ with } w_{\alpha,t} \sim \,\text{N}(0,q_{\alpha})\tag{Eq. 1.1}\\
  \beta_t &= \beta_{t-1} + w_{\beta,t} \text{ with } w_{\beta,t} \sim \,\text{N}(0,q_{\beta}) \tag{Eq. 1.2}.
  \end{align}
  \]

  <p>where the state variables, \( \alpha_t \) and \( \beta_t \), are the intercept and slope of the regression line at time \(t\), respectively. And \(w_{\alpha,t}\) and \(w_{\beta,t}\) are the random error associated with time \(t\) that affect the time-varying state variables \(alpha\) and \(beta\) from time \(t-1\) to \(t\).
  The observation noise for the state variables, \(alpha\) and \(beta\) is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variances \(q_{\alpha}\) and \(q_{\beta}\) for the Scheurell and Williams (2005) SAR estimates. For the DART and CJS SAR methods, the model was initially run without covariates to estimate the observation process noise. This estimated value was then used as a fixed observation process error value when including covariates.

<p>In the evolution equation,  \(m \times 1\) vector of regression parameters is defined as \(\theta_t\) and evolves through time according to the first-order Markov process:</p>

  \[
  \begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{\theta}_t = \mathbf{G}_t\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1} + \mathbf{w}_t \text{ with } \mathbf{w}_t \sim \,\text{MVN}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}) \tag{Eq. 2}\\
  \end{equation}
  \]

  <p>where \(\mathbf{G}_t\) is the parameters evolution matrix, in this case,  an \(m \times m\) identity matrix that informs how the parameters, \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}\), change through time. The system variance matrix, \(\mathbf{w}_t\), represents the evolution process error at time \(t\) (Pole et al., 1994). \(W_t\) is assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrix \(\mathbf{Q}\). For the Scheurell and Williams (2005) SAR method, \(\mathbf{Q}\) was assumed to be diagonal, with differing variances allowed for each state, and no covariance between the states (the off-diagonal elements were fixed at 0). </p>

  \[
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{Q_{\text{diagonal and fixed}}} = \begin{bmatrix}q_\alpha& 0 \\ 0&q_\beta\end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
  \]

  <p>Whereas, for DART and CJS SAR methods we set \(\mathbf{Q}\) to be unconstrained, allowing variance to be estimated for each state and to covary between states, </p>

  \[
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{Q_{\text{unconstrained}}} = \begin{bmatrix}q_\alpha & q_{\alpha\beta} \\q_{\alpha\beta} & q_\beta\end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
  \]

<p>To forecast one-step ahead, a Kalman filter was applied, which is a recursive algorithm that updates the state space parameters and variance at each time step, \(t\), based on the observed data at time \(t -1 \). To forecast on-step ahead, the expected state space parameters and associated variance at the last time step, \(t-1\) were used. The forecasted value at time \(t + 1\) is the result of the expected state space parameter multiplied by the indice of interest at time \(t + 1\). The Kalman filter algorithm was implemented using the MARSS R package (Holmes et al., 2014).
