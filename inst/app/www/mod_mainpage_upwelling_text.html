<p>Scheurell and Williams (2005) hypothesized that upwelling indices, specifically upwelling events in April prior to juveniles entering the ocean in May and June, could be used as a method to forecast salmon survival. Since publication, a new <a href = 'https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/upwelling/intro'> coastal upwelling transport index (CUTI)</a> has been developed that includes upwelling driven by changes in alongshore wind, an element not measured in the coastal upwelling index (CUI) used in publication.</p> Additionally, we have included an index of coastal prey biomass (ICPB) that is based on the winter ichthyoplankton biomass as a predictor of early summer prey fields and survival of juvenile salmon in the northern California Current (Daly et al. 2013).</p>

<p>This application allows you to explore differences in the indices and related changes to the DLM forecast of salmon survival using the smolt-to-adult survival rate (SAR) reported in Scheurell and Williams (2005), along with two other estimates of SAR for comparison, SAR reported Columbia Basin Research DART and an estimate of SAR using a CJS model.</p>
