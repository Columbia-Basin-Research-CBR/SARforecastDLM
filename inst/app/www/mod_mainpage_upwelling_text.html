<p>Scheurell and Williams (2005) hypothesized that upwelling indices, specifically upwelling events in April prior to juveniles entering the ocean in May and June, could be used as a method to forecast salmon survival. Since publication, a new <a href = 'https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/upwelling/intro'> coastal upwelling transport index (CUTI)</a> has been developed that includes upwelling driven by changes in alongshore wind, an element not measured in the coastal upwelling index (CUI) used in publication.</p>

<p>This application allows you to explore differences in the indices and related changes to the DLM forecast of salmon survival using the smolt-to-adult survival rate (SAR) reported in Scheurell and Williams (2005).</p>
