  <p>Scheurell and Williams (2005) hypothesized that upwelling indices, specifically upwelling events in April prior to juveniles entering the ocean in May and June, could be used as a method to forecast salmon survival. Since publication, Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI; Jacox et al., 2018) was developed and includes upwelling driven by changes in alongshore wind, an element not measured in Pacific Coastal Upwelling Index or Bakun index (CUI; Bakun 1973, 1975).</p>

<p>Additionally, we have included two indices of prey availability: Index of Coastal Prey Biomass (ICPB) and Northern Copepod Biomass Index (NCBI). ICPB is derived from winter ichthyoplankton biomass and serves as a predictor of summer Chinook salmon prey, including late-larval and early-juvenile fish species (Daly et al., 2013). NCBI is an index of copepod species richness, that can indicate shifts in biodiversity available to juvenile salmon entering coastal waters in spring/summer months (Hooff and Peterson, 2006).</p>
