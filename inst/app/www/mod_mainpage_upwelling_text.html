  <p>Scheurell and Williams (2005) hypothesized that upwelling indices, specifically upwelling events in April prior to juveniles entering the ocean in May and June, could be used as a method to forecast salmon survival. Since publication, CUTI (Jacox et al., 2018) was developed and includes upwelling driven by changes in alongshore wind, an element not measured in CUI (Bakun 1973, 1975).</p>

<!--  <p>Additionally, we have included the ICPB, which is based on the winter ichthyoplankton biomass as a predictor of summer Chinook salmon prey, including late-larval and early juvenile fish species (Daly et al., 2013).</p> -->

<p>Additionally, we have included the NCBI, an index of copepod species richness that can indicate shifts in biodiversity available to juvenile salmon entering coastal waters in spring/summer months (Hooff and Peterson, 2006).</p>

  <p>This application allows you to explore differences in the indices and related changes to the DLM forecast of salmon survival using the smolt-to-adult survival rate (SAR) reported in Scheurell and Williams (2005), along with two other estimates of SAR for comparison: SAR reported by DART, Columbia Basin Research, and predicted SAR via CJS modelling.</p>
